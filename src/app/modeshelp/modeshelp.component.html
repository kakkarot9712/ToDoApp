<h2> What is Working Mode? </h2>
<p> This app support two types of Data storage solutions, Cloud Mode and Local Mode </p>

<h4> Cloud Mode </h4>
<p> App can store respective Data to the Cloud Server (Firebase Realtime Database). 
    Cloud mode is tied to the account, So when user will Login from 'Authorisation' Tab, 
    app will provide options for Synchronisation (Sync Menu in Header) to cloud. Sync Menu will dissapear from Header and Mode will 
    switch to offline mode whenerver Users Logsout or Login token will expires.
</p>
<h6> Pros and Cons</h6>
<p> 
    As cloud Mode is using 3rd Party firebase storage for storing data. it can be accessed from anywhere.
    On the other hand Data is stored somewhere in the FireBase storage, so that might be Down side for 
    privacy concious personalities.
</p>
<br>
<h4> Local Mode </h4>
<p> In Local storage mode App will use Local device storage for data storage and browsers built-in functions for 
    storing and retrieving data.
</p>
<h6> Pros and Cons</h6>
<p> 
    No 3rd party services is used in Local storage mode. So all data will stay in users device only.
    But in the other hand, Taking backup might be necessary as data will be lost forever if something bad happens to the device

<h5>Note</h5>
<p>
    This app will work in Local mode all the time, What cloud mode does is that it enables possibility to store data into Cloud and fetch at your will.
    As of now <strong>Login will not synchronise Data automatically</strong>, you have to fetch or push data manually from cloud using Sync menu from header.
